# RMM Agent Configuration
#
# This file configures the Linux RMM agent. Copy this file to
# /etc/rmm-agent/config.yaml and update the values for your environment.
#
# IMPORTANT: This file contains sensitive credentials and should have
# restricted permissions: chmod 600 /etc/rmm-agent/config.yaml

# server_url: The base URL of your RMM server.
# Required. No trailing slash.
# Example: https://rmm.yourcompany.com
server_url: "https://rmm.example.com"

# device_token: One-time registration token.
# Required for initial registration. Generate this token in the RMM server
# admin panel. After successful registration, this field can be removed
# (the agent will use api_key instead).
device_token: "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DEVICE_TOKEN"

# api_key: Persistent authentication key.
# This is automatically populated by the agent after successful registration.
# Do not modify this field manually.
api_key: ""

# group: Agent group for organizing devices.
# Required. Used for grouping devices in the server UI, applying policies,
# and staged rollout of updates.
# Examples: "production", "staging", "web-servers", "database-servers"
group: "default"

# poll_interval: How often (in seconds) to poll the server for commands.
# Optional. Default: 60 seconds.
# Shorter intervals = faster command delivery but more server load.
# Longer intervals = less load but delayed command execution.
poll_interval: 60

# jitter_seconds: Maximum random delay added to poll interval.
# Optional. Default: 30 seconds.
# Prevents thundering herd when many agents poll simultaneously.
# Actual delay is random between 0 and jitter_seconds.
jitter_seconds: 30

# log_level: Controls logging verbosity.
# Optional. Default: "info"
# Valid values: "debug", "info", "warn", "error"
# Use "debug" for troubleshooting, "info" for normal operation.
log_level: "info"

# update_enabled: Controls whether the agent checks for and applies updates.
# Optional. Default: true
# Set to false to disable automatic updates (not recommended for production).
update_enabled: true

# update_check_interval: How often (in hours) to check for updates.
# Optional. Default: 24 hours (daily)
# Recommended: 24 hours for production, can be shorter for testing.
update_check_interval: 24
